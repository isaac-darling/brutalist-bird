# brutalist-bird
A genetic artificial intelligence that plays the infamous flappy bird game.

## Notes:
(Circa May 2021)  
At the time I had recently watched a YouTube video about using NEAT AI to solve a racing game, and I decided to apply it to flappy bird (it was the next video in the series, but I wanted to try it myself). I named the project brutalism bird because I opted not to make visually pleasing textures for the game objects, since it wasn'y relevant for the purpose of the AI.
